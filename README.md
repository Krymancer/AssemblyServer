# x86 Assembly Server
A simple HTTP server write in x86 Assembly.

## Why?
Why not?

# Usage
I wrote a Makefile for you, so simple:

    make

# Dependences
Unfortunally i was note able to make a real socket so im using the C socket (take easy please), so make sure you have `gcc-multlib`instaled, if not:

    # apt install gcc-multilib

Of course you need make, so if you don't have:
    
    # apt install make
